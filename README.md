## ‚úÖ Instruction

__1\.__ üîë**Generate an encryption key** to protect user passwords:
    Run this command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```
   python generate_key.py
   ```
___‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You must save the generated encryption key in a secure place.
Without this key, it will be impossible to access or decrypt the data of existing users, and the bot will not function properly.___

__2\.__ Create .env file in the main project folder with your configuration:
```
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
ACCESS_CODE=optional_code_for_user_verification
```

üí° Optional:
If you set ACCESS_CODE=RANDOM in your .env file, the bot will generate a random 8-character access code on startup and display it in the console.
Make sure to check the console output to get the generated code for user authorization.


üöÄStart the bot:
```
- python bot.py
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è  ___When starting the bot, you will be prompted to enter the encryption key each time.  
Make sure to keep this key secure and accessible, as it is required for the bot to access encrypted data.___
